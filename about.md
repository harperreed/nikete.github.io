I go by Nikete, a nickname that stuck, in everything but the most formal of documents.

I run a small consultancy, Amurado Research OU, focused on bringing tools form machine learning, causal inference, and the social sciences to worhty projects. I am also a research affiliate of the Laboratory for Computational Physiology at MIT, where I try to design better algorithms and mechanisms for finding which treatments work for whom when.

Broadly, I am motivated to work towards [the improvement of the understanding](http://bactra.org/Spinoza/TIE/). By desining, building and understanding the computational engines that mediate collective cognition. Methodologically my tools come mostly from economics and machine learning.

Google scholar has a [good first approximation to my academic output](https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=_2Z3DcoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)

Previously I wrote a [PhD thesis](https://github.com/nikete/thesis) at the ANU, on algoirthms and mechanisms for decision making designed to preserve subjects freedom of choice.
