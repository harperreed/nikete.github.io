I am currently writting up the corrections to my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/nikete/thesis), and doing some client work. I am always looking for collaborators, be they more junior or senior. One interesting place 

I try to work for [the improvement of the understanding](http://bactra.org/Spinoza/TIE/). By desining, building and understanding the computational engines that mediate collective cognition. Methodologically my tools come mostly from economics and machine learning.

Google scholar has a [good first approximation to my academic output](https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=_2Z3DcoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
