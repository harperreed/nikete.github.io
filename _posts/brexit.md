Consider the Brexit binary betting markets denominated USD and GBP respectively, with an asset that pays 1 if brexit vote is yes, assume the price of this in their respective currency is 0.4

Let 1 GBP = 1.4 USD at the moment (pre-brexit), and 1.2 if brexit vote is yes, and 1.6 if brexit vote is no. 

Then carrey out the following trades:

Buy 1.4 units of the asset in the USD market ( pay 0.56 USD )
Sell 1 unit of the asset in the GBP market (earn  0.0.56 UD)

If Brexit:

earn 1.4 USD and pay out 1 GBP, which at this point costs 1.2 USD, net profit 0.2

if no brexit: then net profit 0.

We can sell a larger amount (say 1.1) in the GBP brexit market to guarantee a strictly positive profit in every state of the world, at the cost of making the algebra less neat.

The 0.2 down move on GBP conditonal on a brexit yes vote and 0.2 up on a no vote is my rough eyeballing the implied volatilies in http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/06/14/expected-pound-volatility-strikes-post-crisis-high/ , I am very keen for better estimates of this)
