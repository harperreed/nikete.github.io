title: Choice DAO
---


A design principle for collective cognition sugested by Hanson as _Futarchy_ is, : vote on values, bet on beliefs.
Two types of beliefs can be distingished; those about what will happen no matter what, such as the weather, and those whose outcomes depend on a choice informed by the beliefs (such as what symptoms you will have after taking a given medication). 

How to structure bets about future events that are publically observable is extremey well understood, and practical protocols exist to do this in a fairly trustless and decentralized way.
How to structure bets about which course of action will lead to the highest payoff is much less clear, even with a trusted center. (see: <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/decision%20rules%20and%20decision%20markets.AAMAS10.pdf> ).
Individuals, and smart contract, need to elicit not some static property of the future (who will win X, will Y happen) but knowledge of which is the optimal action, and it's expected outcome distribution (for downstream planning).

Structured as bootstraping experiment, to iterate on what choices the DAO itself makes in researching and developing open protocols for eliciting what choices to take.
