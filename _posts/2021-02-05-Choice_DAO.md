title: An experiment in collective choice making by betting on beliefs. 
---




A design principle influential in the cryptocurrency comunity for collective decision making sugested by Hanson as _Futarchy_ is, : vote on values, bet on beliefs.
Smart contract governance has so far focused on voting by stake holders, with little use of betting on beliefs.
Two types of beliefs can be distingished; those about what will happen no matter what, such as the weather, and those whose outcomes depend on a choice informed by the beliefs (such as the health of a patient after taking a given medication, or the profits of a market maker using a given bid-ask spread). 

How to structure bets about future events that are publically observable is extremey well understood, and practical protocols exist to do this in a fairly trustless and decentralized way.
How to structure bets about which course of action will lead to the highest payoff is much less clear, even with a trusted center. <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/decision%20rules%20and%20decision%20markets.AAMAS10.pdf>.
Individuals, and smart contracts, need to elicit not some static property of the future (who will win X, will Y happen) but knowledge of which is the optimal action, and it's expected outcome distribution (for downstream planning).


Structured as bootstraping experiment, to iterate on what choices the DAO itself makes in researching and developing open protocols for eliciting what choices to take.

A proposal for an initial task, the DAO could create a ERC777 and become a liquidity provider for it and the pairs the memebers of the DAO decide to fund in the exchanges and AMMs the DAO decides, with the choice of liquidity provision schedule to be made using a incentive compatible. The deicsions themselves made also using the mechanism.
